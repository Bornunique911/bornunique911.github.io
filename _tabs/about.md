I am a cybersec enthusiast and aim to work as a professional. I enjoy actively participating in CTFs as they help me grow my skills. I am actively active on TryHackMe and HackTheBox from where I started learning cybersecurity. I like to learn new things and try them out and spread knowledge to the friends which are still learning cybersecurity.
